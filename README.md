# IBM_Cloud_Predictive_Maintenance

Predictive maintenance is a crucial application of machine learning in industrial settings, where unplanned equipment failures can lead to costly downtime and safety risks. This project focuses on building a predictive model that identifies the type of machine failure—such as tool wear, heat dissipation issues, or power failure—before it occurs, using real-time sensor data.

By leveraging IBM Cloud AutoAI, the system automates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The goal is to support proactive maintenance strategies that improve equipment reliability, reduce operational costs, and enhance overall productivity in industrial environments.
